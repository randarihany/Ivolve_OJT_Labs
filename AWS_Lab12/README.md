# Lab 12: Launching an EC2 Instance with a Bastion Host

- Objective
In this lab, you'll learn how to:

Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with both public and private subnets.
Launch an EC2 instance in each subnet (one in the public subnet and one in the private subnet).
Configure security groups to allow only inbound SSH traffic from the public EC2 instance to the private EC2 instance.
Use the public EC2 instance (bastion host) to SSH into the private EC2 instance.
Prerequisites
Before proceeding, make sure you have:

- Steps to Complete the Lab

Step 1: Create a VPC
Open the VPC Dashboard in the AWS Management Console.

Click Create VPC.

Choose the following settings:

VPC Name: Main_VPC
IPv4 CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/16.
IPv6 CIDR block: No IPv6.
Tenancy: Default.
Click Create VPC.

Step 2: Create Subnets
Create one public subnet and one private subnet within the VPC.


- Public Subnet
In the VPC dashboard, go to Subnets and click Create subnet.

Choose your newly created VPC and set the following:

Subnet Name: PublicSubnet
Availability Zone: Choose any available AZ.
IPv4 CIDR block: 10.0.1.0/24.
Auto-assign Public IP: Enable.
Click Create subnet.

- Private Subnet
Click Create subnet again.

Choose your VPC and set the following:

Subnet Name: PrivateSubnet
Availability Zone: Choose any available AZ.
IPv4 CIDR block: 10.0.2.0/24.
Click Create subnet.

Subnet Output:

Step 3: Set Up an Internet Gateway
Go to Internet Gateways in the VPC dashboard.
Click Create internet gateway.
Name it MyInternetGateway.
Click Create.

Attach the internet gateway to your VPC by selecting the gateway and clicking Actions â†’ Attach to VPC. Select your VPC and click Attach.

Step 4: Route Tables Configuration
Public Subnet Route Table
Go to Route Tables in the VPC dashboard.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f19f2ae-d6cd-451f-afd5-1169c484b637)

Select the Main Route Table and click Edit routes.

Add a route to allow outbound internet traffic:

Destination: 0.0.0.0/0.
Target: Select your Internet Gateway.
Click Save routes.

Associate subnet to route table:

Private Subnet Route Table
Create a new route table for the private subnet.

In Route Tables, click Create route table.

Name it PrivateRouteTable.
Choose the same VPC.
Click Create.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e630cdb3-c0cd-444a-a144-6222662d5c1a)

Select the new route table, and click Edit routes.

Associate the private route table with the PrivateSubnet.

Step 5: Launch EC2 Instances
Launch Public EC2 Instance (Bastion Host)
Go to the EC2 Dashboard and click Launch Instance.

Choose an Amazon Linux AMI (Amazon Machine Image).

Select an instance type (e.g., t2.micro).

Configure the instance to be in the PublicSubnet.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3076042-072c-4d86-81f2-9c147a1f3259)
In the Configure Security Group, create a new security group (PublicSecurityGroup) with the following rules:

Type: SSH
Source: 0.0.0.0/0 (or your IP for limited access).
Launch the instance and download the private key (.pem file).

Output:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f1e4cec-3548-43bc-8133-02e59cb8f0e6)


Launch Private EC2 Instance
Launch a second EC2 instance in the PrivateSubnet with the same AMI and instance type as the public instance.

In the Configure Security Group, create a new security group (PrivateSecurityGroup) with the following rules:

Type: SSH
Source: Custom IP (select the public EC2 instance's security group).
Launch the instance and download its private key.

Step 6: Set Up SSH Access via the Bastion Host
From your local machine, SSH into the public EC2 instance using its public IP and the downloaded .pem key.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/910bd597-0a70-4432-8776-e96aae5ff9b9)

Output:

bash
Copy
ssh -i /path/to/your/public-key.pem ec2-user@<Public-EC2-Public-IP>
- From the public EC2 instance (the bastion host), SSH into the private EC2 instance using its private IP:

- From Bastion Host:
Copy private key first
