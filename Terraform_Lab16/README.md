# Lab 16: Multi-Tier Application Deployment with Terraform

## Objective
- Create a VPC manually.
- Use Terraform to manage this VPC.
- Implement the architecture shown below using Terraform.
- Use a local provisioner to write the EC2 instance's IP address to a file called `ec2-ip.txt`.

## Steps to Complete the Lab

### Step 1: Create a VPC Manually
- **VPC only** option (without additional resources).
- Configure the VPC with the following settings:
   - **IPv4 CIDR Block**: `10.0.0.0/16`
   - **Tenancy**: Default

**VPC Configurations:**

**VPC Outputs:**

### Step 2: Import the VPC into Terraform
1. Initialize Terraform:
```
terraform init
```
2.Import the manually created VPC into Terraform:

```
terraform import aws_vpc.main vpc-0c2d15a417e3da752
```

**Import Result:**

### Step 3: Set Up Terraform Configuration:
- [Go to]Terraform_Lab16/code

- That includes:
  - Provider: Specifies the AWS region where resources will be created.
  - VPC: We reference the manually created VPC by its ID.
  - Subnet: Creates a subnet within the manually created VPC.
  - EC2 Instance: Creates an EC2 instance inside the subnet with SSH access. The local-exec provisioner runs after the instance is created and writes the EC2 instanceâ€™s public 
    IP to a file called ec2-ip.txt in the local working directory.
### Step 4: Initialize and Apply Terraform Configuration:

- Initialize Terraform:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### Step 5: Verify the EC2 IP in the File

After Terraform has successfully applied the configuration, it will execute the local-exec provisioner and write the EC2 instance's public IP to a file called ec2-ip.txt in your local directory.

You can open the ec2-ip.txt file to verify the IP address of the EC2 instance.
